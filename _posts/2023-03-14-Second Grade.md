We were going to Britain in the summer of second grade

But I had bumps in my breast

I asked mom, fearfully, after she had bought the plane tickets

and proposed a travel plan, labelling all the places we’d go

“Will I be able to go?”

My mom laughed and affirmed me I can,

“More than you can.”

In showers I pinched them

hard and firm above my heart beneath my skin

Later I stopped, because it became painful

I thought I had stones in my heart

and I regret dying so young.

Mom took me to the hospital

The sensors touched my skin

Penetrating into my body

No, of course they can’t see through me

Of course they can’t go into me

“A little too early,” said the doctor

“Your little friend.”

What friend?

A friend that makes me eat pills — 50 a day!

A friend that pains me as I laid down my breast in bed

A friend — as I later would have known — that bears me

the tears of passivity and submissiveness and penetration

A friend — as I later would have encounter — that strips my clothes away

Leaving only an egg, a womb, and Lolita.

3/10 at math exam, final touches on 3/14
