why do we analyze our feelings / emotions: to demystify it

however, the further we dig into the explanations for our feelings, the further we are from it

we are separating away from the true meaning of our actions and we are merely looking at our manifested actions / feelings while unable to reach the latent feelings

we are looking and it from an outsider’s perspective (alienated)

the real meaning of your actions is hidden from you

we are applying theories that either we or other developed to explain our actions and feel superior to this understanding and the process of explaining these actions

normative model of human experience that everything has to conform to

puts too much power in the expert of the psychiatrist / psychoanalyst that explains your actions and experiences to you

alienates people from their experiences and dismiss people from their experiences

same to art interpretation

art analyst / critique seeking superiority over the art they are studying

art theory is trying to fit every work of art into the theories created and dismiss further meanings

to interpret is to impoverish

we need to be aware of this interpretation

focus on the form of art and style of the art

embrace more possibilities

not putting yourself in the interpretation of art to forcefully reach to a seemingly deeper meaning

sees the art as the artist sees it

discard the ego of the critique

best form of art

open ended and ongoing

life is similar to this analysis of the interpretation of art

My own interpretation of this idea / concept: (it’s kind of funny how this idea presented here talks about the cons of interpretation while I am interpreting the idea itself. but i think compared to the interpretation of art (artwork, life, experience, etc), this is more of a logical analysis and a rational interpretation rather than sentimental interpretation that related to the feelings and perceptions of oneself like the process of analysis for art. despite this controversy, i am, however, present several points and interpretations that i think is interesting in this idea)

in the following analysis, art refers to anything that is

1. in the interpretation of art, we try to seek meaning most of the time and force this meaning that we ourselves either created or referenced to the previous meanings / theories on to the art itself, alternating the art from subjective (subjectivity due to the inability of full interpretation of all people except for the artist theirselves) to objective (objectivity due to the enforcement of objective meaning). that is, that when we interpret art with our own eyes, either using our past experiences or using art theories, we are creating a new work of art rather than seeking meaning in the original art. thus, we are alienating ourselves away from the true meaning of art.

2. another interpretation that i see in sontag’s argument is that because we are unable to ever reach the true meaning of art, it can also be due to that possibility that it does not possess meaning ever since it was created and existed. this can also relate to cioran’s belief of the meaningless of the world: everything is without meaning. however, we are blinded by this notion of meaninglessness and were taught in a society where everything has to be explained and thus rationalized, that there is seldom emotionalized and irrationalize actions / experiences. in addition, with the advancement of philosophy, psychology, and sociology, human behaviors are thus categorized into theories and trends that are seemingly reasonable but are merely illusions to explain the manifest phenomena in society. furthermore, with the evolution of technology, especially the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence in recent years, as well as the development of data science, statistics, economics, and etc., we are inclining to a society where we expect to use the theories and laws that we observed and created to give explanations, predict the future, and to create meaning for the future, which, despite its seemingly short term success, will eventually drive us furrhe away from the true meaning of life. this is because we bestow too much power in the laws of society, as we bestow too much trust in the hands of the psychiatrist, desperately searching for patterns and meanings and trying to fit every aspect of life into the patterns and meanings that we found, forgetting that it is us who made up societies and that it is us whose brain is so complex and irrational that any pattern or theories are unable to explain. (i feel like my reasoning is extremely flawed…)

3. why do people want to seek meanings in art? sontag pointed out that it is due to the feeling of superiority that people possess when interpreting the art. (now writing about this point, i actually thought of a question / flaw in sontag’s argument here… while it might be true that people do feel the sense of superiority when they seemingly interpret the art, but doesn’t this phenomena / behavior conform to the general behavior of human nature? isn’t this a type of interpretation that can be flawed and wrong and drive us away from the true purpose behind the interpret ion a piece of art? i do not have an answer to that yet. maybe what i said can be a flaw, but i’m just going to ignore it for now since i want to share something more interesting) this “superiority” that sontag mentions is also similar to the greed of human nature: people want to possess things through the act of trying to understand them. in life, we call a person a professional if they possess deep knowledge in a particular realm. similar to this “professional”, we want to seek meaning — meaning that other people do not see — to prove our abilities and thus showcase a superior and supreme position, thus transforming the art into a personalize item — similar to the idea talked about in 1.

4. this point is just a simple positive thought when applying sontag’s idea onto real life. sontag talks about how we should view art as the artist views it: from its style, it form, and simply, from art itself. i read a passage by a chinese high school student who is applying to u.s. universities last year (2023er). there was one section in the passage that i can relate to so much: the author attended some part of her elementary school life in america, and when she was interviewed by the college about why she wanted to study abroad, she simply answered, “not everything has to have a meaning”. realizing that this is short passage as well as sontag’s idea is so similar, i thought back on my life and my experiences. there are, of course, a lot of things that i regret in my life, a lot of failures i seek answers to why i failed, and a lot of depressed days i seem to lose hope. however, upon listening to sontag’s idea, i was introduced to a new way of viewing my own experiences, both happy and unhappy: to view them just as they are, to enjoy the moment rather than seeking interpretation and explanation, and to rejoice and focus on the moments that passed. (now i realized that some of my previous points are extremely flawed: i should not have mixed up meaning with interpretation…)

anyways, these are some of my thoughts on this episode of susan sontag’s ideas. i know my reasoning can sometimes be very illogical and faulty, but this is simply a quick jot-down of my thoughts rather than a very formal essay, so i’ll just keep it as it is. (it also shows the flow of my thoughts!)
