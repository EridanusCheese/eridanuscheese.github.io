The “awakening” occurred in fifth grade. I was complaining to my classmate about how female pronouns are changed into male pronouns in Chinese when referring to a group of girls with the addition of a single boy. Years later I would learn that this is the norm of the “default male”, the society is making us normalizing the irrational, and I would ultimately become one of the many people fighting for equality.

Born in a rather underdeveloped small city in the inland, we live in serenity and seldom experience the collisions of different viewpoints; feminism and gender minorities were non-existent concepts, but they were also the concepts that took me a long time to explore and eventually lead my irresistible interest in them.

At the new year’s family dinner, with relatives from rural towns gather together, women were seated closer to the door—a sign of lower position. My aunts feed younger children, not having time to eat themselves, while my uncles cared for older children and chatted. Out of respect, I did not question. When we went back to our villages in Qingming Festival to honor our ancestors, I noticed that the wife and the husband’s grave is always placed in the husband’s hometown. But I dare not to disobey tradition.

My increasing awakenings through observing minute norms in my conservative society, however, led to more doubts and eventually turned into “rebellious” actions: listening to podcasts on abortion rights, reading feminism theories, and debating with my friends on gender minority rights. So intrigued by the unknown and so happy to find theories that explain my quasi-nonsense complaints, I delved deeper. Still, however, I kept these thoughts to myself; I acquiesced in our social norm.

It was when I read the diaries of a hostess in Japan, where she talked about the commercialization of women and her control yet imprisonment of her body in Kabukicho, did I realized feminism and the human race has an extremely long way to go. The feminine autonomy of prostitution, gender inequalities showcased in host and hostess clubs, and what we seek in the future world as feminists were the things that I contemplated on as I read Chizuko Ueno’s books on the controversial industries in Japan and as I inadvertently recognized the male gaze in anime and manga.

I took action. From writing a letter to the school principle on encouraging girls to thrive in STEM to establishing the school magazine and choosing the topic of the first issue to be “great women”, I started to get involved in raising the awareness of gender inequality. Constantly, however, I struggle in the dilemma of women autonomy and male gaze—can the autonomous women exonerate men and how can we balance between the two?

I flashed back on how I still was a naive newborn in feminism, how I persisted in doubting the contemporary social norm, and how the conservative and traditional society that I was part of remind me of the importance of feminism in underdeveloped regions—to give women back their own life. Thus, I hope to provide new insights and real life experiences of the struggles of poor and uneducated women, especially east Asian women, which intermingles with avant-garde feminism in western culture, enabling a thorough analyses of women in different situations.
