On my monthly trips to the old people’s home to see my grandma, we would often converse in seemingly meaningless conversations. Sometimes it was as if she was drunk–grabbing the hands of unknown workers and blandly asking them questions of “Are you the same?” or “Do you want to come too?” and pulling them along with her. At other times it seems that in her head time has stopped moving and that she has lived in her own little world ever since she has Alzheimer’s–she would ask the same question “Which grade are you in?” over and over again or inquire about where my mother is even when my mom is right in front of her. In our meaningless conversations about food, weather, and answering her unanticipated questions, it seemed, however, that she was finally free: free of the constraints of the world and of her past burdens, as she gradually leaves her memories behind.

My grandma is the ninth child in her family. She is the youngest girl, but she was also the only kid that went to school and graduated high school. Her family was a poor family living in the suburbs of Tangkou, a small town that is still poor and undeveloped to this day. Her dad used to work for rich families in the area to help them run errands; he would carry a pole with heavy loads in it, which made his legs swollen and made him limp even until his death. Her entire family lived in a small room. Her five brothers did not go to school–even elementary school–because their family was too poor to afford school. Instead, they started working in a mining farm at Kuimeishan to mine iron when they were fifteen years old. Her three sisters did not go to high school either: they farm for rich families. Grandma told me that one of her brothers died at twenty years old of pulmonary disease because he had caught too much dust while working on the mining farm.

My grandma always considers herself lucky. She was born during the Chinese Civil War, but a few years later, the war ended and the Land Reform Movement was held in China, which redistributed land from landlords to farmers. After the movement, their family obtained some land and moved into a bigger house. Their lives became better.

My grandma is proud that she was born into her family. “You know, my family was never the kind of traditional families that look down upon girls.” she said. When she reached the age of attending school, their family was able to afford it and sent her to school. Although her education journey came to an end after graduating high school, she is still proud of it, for she loves calling herself “a natural leader” in high school. “I was the captain of the girl’s basketball team, and I would lead the whole team running laps around our town Nankang every morning at six o’clock,” my grandma said enthusiastically, “I was even the president of the student council.”

“What did you do then?” I asked.

“Ah!” She gave out a light laugh. “You know, trivial things. Arranging students to clean the school. Maintaining order during lunch. Helping out school events.”

When she was a senior in high school, students stopped attending classes because of the Cultural Revolution. Students gathered together to rebel and put up posters showing “Down with the bourgeoisie!” around school. My grandma was also active in these movements. Ignorant of her family’s worries of her going around China to join the movement as a girl, she went to schools in other regions, uniting students to rebel. (I have to check with my grandma about this part) She was daring and brave. Sometimes, she is the Mulan in my life.

After graduating high school, my grandma worked at a local factory to make components for machines. Later when she had two kids and my grandpa was serving in the army in Shanxi province, she had to leave the town and move to northern China for a few years until my grandpa left the army because the government was downsizing the military. When she came back, she still worked as a factory worker knitting shoe insoles, and several years later she became an accountant.

Grandma never lived an easy life. She always told me about how their family used to eat tree barks when there was no food and how sometimes they relied on one sausage for the whole month to add flavor to their daily plain rice meals.

In her life I still see remnants of the past society: she always gets blamed by my grandpa for trivial things; she does not know her exact birthday because in the past people didn’t tell girls their birthday; during our New Year’s dinner with other family members, female family members would sit in the “less respected” seats and would care for small children while male family members would sit in the “more respected” seats and laugh and talk.

Grandma is a daring and courageous woman. I learned a lot from her. I learned cooking, and when I was cooking in her kitchen I used to call myself “the chef” and she “the helper.” I learned sewing and crocheting, and I would delve into her drawer for different kinds of yarn and fabric. She taught me love, not only love for people but also love for this city and the home I live in. She taught me calmness, for she never gets angry. She taught me confidence, for she is always brave inside her heart despite her tears that made her seem vulnerable.

I tried to be like my grandma in my life. She is always a giver to others, so I became a giver as well, helping kids that have a hard childhood like her through writing letters and meeting them every semester to bring happiness and care. She is a leader, so I became a leader as well, organizing a TEDx Youth event that focuses on conveying the philosophy of kintsugi through different disciplines.

Now I see her sitting on her bed, with two naked feet hanging in the air, shaking back and forth like a curious child. I see wrinkles that inform me about the life that grandma had gone through in the past. She became much shorter than before. “Not enough to be a basketball player!” I thought, half jokingly. But even to this point, when grandma barely recalls anything, she still inspires me: be a child, be naive, and be full of curiosity to explore the world around me.

Note: I did not check grammar, so there will be some grammar mistakes.
