I submitted this for the final round of application to the [Tencent Kexue Miaozi Program][org] under the category of Black Hole properties. Unfortunately, I was shortlisted. I actually spent a LOT of time preparing for this: reading countless articles on the measurement techniques, searching for online resources, and asking my mentors to check if there are any mistakes. I was quite disappointed by the news but could understand and accept the results as I had the feeling that I did not do so well on the final interview. (Just hope I can get into a decent university! ðŸ¤ž)
