(Coursera course: Feminism and Social Justice https://www.coursera.org/learn/feminism-social-justice/home/week/1)

equality means comparable, human

collective empowerment – this is a social movement; cannot be achieved unless all are liberated from oppression

economic independence – women’s wages are (significantly) lower than men’s wages

have control over our own bodies

fluidity of gender

gender is a social construct

dominant and recessive genes – hierarchies and systems of dominance

central idea: personal is political and political is personal – subordination of women occur in intimate places – women speak up for themselves from their personal experiences because there were no books

gender is related to anger and aggression – the angry women is often depicted as hysterical

Class question: Why wouldn’t a member of a dominant group notice the nuances of oppression?

My answer: We are familiar with the environment that we grow up with/belong to and think that these environments are inherent. A member of a dominant group will usually grow up with having privileges that they believe are inherent to them. Thus, they usually do not question the origins of these privileges, and similarly, they seldom times notice that they have privileges that other people–less dominant people–have. Even if they do, this “guaranteed” privileged social status usually creates a sense of “proudness” so that they would look down upon people that are of less dominant than them, which blinds them from the real sufferings of the oppressed people.
the purpose of feminist studies: learn in-depth and in-breadth understanding of the gendered oppression of women and everything that is intertwined with it

Discussion: How do you define feminism? Does your definition differ from the definition proffered in this course? How? What are the primary feminist struggles in your culture or country?

My thoughts: Prior to watching the course, I thought of feminism as the interdisciplinary study of women, i.e. women’s history, laws protecting women’s rights, women’s future, etc. Overall, my perception of feminism was quite vague and too narrow. My definition, after listening to the course, changes to this: feminism is a study of humans that advocates and emphasizes on equality, especially for minority groups. The course also highlights the prerequisites of achieving this equality, like the necessity of the collective empowerment of women and the need for control over their own bodies. My definition, in my opinion, more concisely summarizes the ultimate purpose of feminism: to reconstruct the society into a place where everyone experiences equality while the definition offered in the course elaborated on the various conditions in which this equality can be established.

In my country, women, like women in other parts of the world , are the oppressed in many situations. Overall, the examples of women from rural areas better showcases the struggles that women in my country is experiencing. Due to the fact that we have a huge wealth gap between the rich and the poor, and that resources are allocated unequally between cities and rural regions, women in rural regions often experiences severe impacts of gender discrimination. Women in rural areas could be chained up by their husbands and turn into a “reproduction machine”; women might stay at home and become housewives; women have no choice to choose their own marriage, and usually, it is the men who have the active choice of choosing his wife. In rural areas, being born as a female is a disgrace to both the mother and the family; the mother will often times be disrespected by the family if she only gives birth to a girl; the girl will be regarded as a burden to the family.

For underdeveloped regions, the basic idea of gender equality is still not established, and many consider females as the inferior sex. In more developed places, however, women faces other situations. One might think that women may seemingly experience a slightly more equal gender relationships. However, this is not true. Women living in cities undergo a different form of oppression—a kind of oppression that is much more intimate and hidden. A post of a young girl showing her grandpa’s happiness and joy when he was shared with the news that his granddaughter has obtained a bachelor’s degree was commented by many as “unreal” simply because of her dyed pink hair. Many online users continue to bully her by calling her “slut”, “bitch”, “prostitute”, and other extremely insulting words, because in their opinions, a woman who dye her hair pink, or any other “weird” color, must be a person who sells her body and who seduces men for a living. Just one month ago, the girl committed suicide because of the constant online bullying she receives. There are much more similar cases like this happening every day. Women are almost always to be viewed as a representation of sex by men. The sexualization of women is most common in media, photos, advertisements, film, books, etc. In families, the anger of women is forbidden for it depicts the women as hysterical and mad beings while the anger of men can sometimes be encouraged, or at least allowed, for it represents the power of the masculine dominance of the men in the household.
