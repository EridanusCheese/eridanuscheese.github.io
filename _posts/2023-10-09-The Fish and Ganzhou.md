description: In this city, its own orchestra performs day and night.

In this city, its own orchestra performs day and night – the evening breeze from the river is the violinist, the leaves rubbing against the thousand-year-old stone slabs are the cellists, the wanderers at the ancient walls are the flutists, the familiar Gannan accent ringing in my ears are the drummers, and I, who stands among them while panically fidgeting with a long thin stick, am conductor.

I have asked many people why they like this city. My mom says she feels comfortable here, for this city bestows upon its citizens peace and quiescence rather than the hustle and bustle common in a metropolis. The grandmother who sells tofu pudding in the alleys says she has lived here all her life and has made a promise with the soil here that she would never leave. The security guard at Fushougou Museum says the city has brought too many surprises – the drainage system that is still in use today and the preserved Song city that is over 900 years old.

If I were to say my first impression of the city, it would be the water. Right after I was born I was carried to my grandmother’s house. Grandma’s house was near Zhangjiang, or Zhang River. I was immersed in a world of water. But I hated the water, because it seems to be able to tolerate all the good and bad in the world, and because water is so pure and simple that when I walk along the river and look at my reflection in the water, what I saw is guilt and panic in my heart. Water is a mirror, but also a Pensieve. As I stand by the river, the sound of water seems like the sound of my memories being flipped through. Water digs out all my shame, and little by little they sunk into the bottom of the water.

My whole life revolves around water. Water separates my city, but still it surrounds and embraces it, as if holding the old city with both hands. It is water that separates the two ends of the city, but it is also water that connects the them. On the water, people built pontoons. The pontoon bridge is composed of many wooden boats and planks. It floats on the water and blends with it. Walking on the pontoon bridge, the bridge body shakes with people’s footsteps. On the almost worn out and wooden boards, there are imprints of water. The bridge rises and falls with the breath of the water, constantly conforming to the rhythm of life in the river, as if the water endows the pontoon with life, supports its life, and gives it the meaning of life. There is also water at the foot of the ancient city walls. Next to the flowing and gentle river water stands a majestic city wall made of gray and black stone slabs, bringing vitality and dynamic to the monotonous static buildings. This is also the way of life in this city: tranquil like the river flowing quietly and occasional bustles like the water rippling. The people and stories here also melt in this city like the water that surrounds it.

I’m a nostalgic person. The pleasures of living in old town in my childhood are gone. The buildings in the old town are placed close to each other; gray and black bricks and brownish-red wooden frames are neatly arranged; a wide range of merchandise is placed behind the windows without looking cluttered. The people coming and going bring not a sense of discomfort but rather a feeling of humane warmth.

Walking across the old pontoon bridge, I entered the old town again. At the end of the pontoon bridge are many vendors selling turtles, hamsters, kittens and puppies, and fresh fish and dried fish. Apart from the people traveling between the old and new towns, there are also people who come to buy fish at the pontoon bridge. It was on that occasion, as I slowed down to walk between the wooden boats that people use as stalls, that I heard the cry of a fish for the first time.

In a blue basin filled with shallow water were seven yellowhead catfish, swimming back and forth with their tails wagging slowly. Yellowhead catfish is a kind of fish we often cook into soup, and we would a few fried eggs in it.

“Hey! How much are these?” An old lady shouted as she stood in front of the water basket.

“Thirteen per fish.” The hoarse voice with a thick accent said. His clothes were rotted with many holes, wrinkled and stained with earth-colored mud and dirt, and hung loosely from his bony frame, ready to fall apart at the slightest push. His dark skin seemed to melt into the hanging dusty fabric of the ship’s hatchway. Two yellow eyeballs were protrude out in the sunken eye sockets. I couldn’t really tell his age; he was surprisingly shriveled compared to a middle-aged man of 50, but he seemed be more mobile than an 80-year-old. He poked his head out. His eyes fixed on the lady. It was the look you get when you see a faint weed while hanging off a cliff.

“Make it cheaper. I’ll take all of ‘em.”

“Can’t. These are the only fish I can sell.” He opened his mouth, and like a rusty machine finally starting to run after a decade of slumber, the sound that came out of his throat was the like constant rubbing of two rusty iron bars. Too harsh.
“I’ll take all of these in this basin.” As if she was afraid he wouldn’t understand, the old lady said it again.

“……”

“10 it is. It’s not like these few bucks.” Seeing that he didn’t answer, the old lady continued, and with that, she pulled out 70 RMB from her purse and handed it to him. “Dissect them as well.”

He stared at the money in the old lady’s hand for several seconds before slowly taking it, putting his face in front of the bills and counting them one by one, and when he was done, he pressed it under the gray pillow he was sitting on.

He stepped out and knelt behind the basin, his bamboo-like fingers gripping the fish and swiftly lifting it from the water and pressing it to the cutting board beside him. The fish writhed in his hands, its mouth opening and closing, but it made no sound. He slapped the knife against the fish’s head a few times, and the fish, which had just tried to break free, was now motionless. The fish’s eyes stared straight ahead, its mouth half-open, unable to speak its last words.

He picked up the scissors and paused with his hand in mid-air for half a second before quickly cutting through its anus. Just as the two blades of the scissors closed over the fish’s skin, I heard – for the first time in my life – the fish scream.

“——”

It was a raucous scream. It continued until when he cut the belly of the fish open to the head, the screaming stopped abruptly.

How could a fish scream? But I did hear it, that shriek. Its half-open mouth cried out unceasingly, and at times the sound seemed to be imprinted with the voice of the fish seller.

I was standing next to the fish seller. Suddenly, I wanted to cover my ears and run away, or grab the fish and the scissors from him. But I just stood there, watching the fish seller knock the fish out again and again, cutting their bellies open again and again, and hearing their cries again and again. The fish seller moved faster and faster. As if he was starting to panic, he grabbed, knocked out, and cut open those yellowhead catfish. The cries of the fish grew fainter and fainter. The cries, I don’t know how I knew they were cries. Their cries are dry and sharp, not at all drawn out and pretentious. But why do I hear the sound of wet tears dripping in this dry screech? Why do the fish only cry at the last moment when the scissors have already cut through the skin and there would be no way back? Do they want to ask the fish seller for help only at this point? Or do they want to plead with the old lady? Do they believe that the half-second that the fish seller, with scissors in his hand, stayed in the air is a moment of hesitation for him to spare their lives?

But I think the fish seller is like his fish. He fell into despair as they were when he grabbed them, and at the moment of the old lady bargaining he had no choice but to gave in. He sealed his fate when he took the old lady’s bill without a word. Or was it his fate is destined a long time ago? His pause for the fish was a final prayer for them. I don’t even think he ever prayed in his life before, because people always remember to ask God for a miracle when in despair. Just like how the walls of hospitals may have heard more prayers than the stained windows of churches. His fish were also sympathetic, for they may had cried for the fish seller as well. Perhaps they cried for life being too short; perhaps they cried for life being too humble.

As is the case with too many things I encounter, I seem to be always indifferent. I quietly watched the fish seller finish disemboweling all the fish, leaving only an empty basin in front of him, and I then stepped onto the pontoon bridge with the crowd. The river turned into a black hole that engulfed my body and mind.

In this city, I kept falling down, falling into the black hole of the river, unable to see the end. I thought back to the people and things I saw in this city. When I was a child, I often came across a old lady selling tofu pudding in an alley. Her equipment was very simple: a bamboo pole and two wooden buckets, one of which was filled with white, soft tofu pudding and the other with soy sauce, green onions, ginger, chili peppers, and other seasonings. The old lady sat in a small, dark and narrow place, placing the two barrels outside, while she herself blend into the gloom where the sun did not shine in. As time pass, the old lady and I grew familiar. We would chat while I sat on the small stool she prepared, using the wooden barrel as a table. Her short, thin body sat across from me. It was as if I were having a meal at home; it was warm and happy. Then as my family moved, my life drifted away from the old town. The “fancy” breakfasts were replaced with slice after slice of tasteless wheat bread. I rarely go out for breakfast anymore. Instead, I order takeout and have it delivered to my door. At the same time, the unintentional coziness of being face-to-face with a stranger has drifted away.

There are still too many people and stories that silently exist in this small city, and these people and stories make up this city. She is like the universe, like a self-conscious universe, with her own laws of operation, constantly rendering the colors of her own universe for the people of this city, letting them adapt to her own laws of physics. This universe stores my guilt and carries my warmth. In this universe, there exists a star-like warmth in the connections between people, a black hole swallowing my shame, stellar systems of families, and galaxies of communities. The water is like dark matter in this universe, holding two lands together. This city is a universe of billions of years, and we are not dust that will eventually be forgotten, but a part of what makes up her and ever present within her.

Note: I did not check grammar, so there will me some grammar mistakes.
