Aldridge. Fifth grade.
Dallas. Texas.
Me and my dad.
That day at school we talked about growing up.
Girls and boys, separately.
Each of us girls were given
A tank top —
I suppose, but I’m not sure —
Wrapped in blue plastic.
I buried it with books and a pencil pouch
Inside my bag.
Not to mourn a new, long lost friend.
At home, a few days later
When my dad was showering
I hastily opened the black trash bag — God thank it’s black!
Bidding farewell to someone I never understand, “Adieu! My friend!”
“May we never encounter again!”
Not knowing that
One year later she will comeback as blood,
And she will make friends with her.

(This is a true story of myself. (So was the last poem I posted.) I wanted to present the shame embarrassment I felt when encountered with the topic of growing up and changes in my body.)
