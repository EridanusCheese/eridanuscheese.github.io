160 cm. 51 kg.

This is my height and weight.

“Fat pig.” “big butt.”

This is what my mom calls me every time she sees me. Not out of intimacy or affection, but out of pure dissatisfaction of my body weight and shape.

It started when I was in eighth grade, during the lockdown period when I wasn’t able to go to school and had to stay at home. I ran every day around our apartment and did jump ropes, but I guess it was simply because the food I made each day at home was much better than cafeteria food. I started gaining weight, from 45 kg to 48 kg, and my mom started from telling me to eat more to forcing me to eat less. When I was in ninth and tenth grade, when we almost had no time for exercise and had to be stuck in our seats doing practice tests every day, I grew to 52 kg. Back home my mom would shame me for being fat, punching my body and calling me a “pig,” giving me a plain piece of toast for every meal, and telling me I look ugly in every outfit I wear because I’m fat and ugly.

At first I thought they were mere jokes, like the ones my friends would make to each other, nicely teasing each other and laughing them off. Then I realized they were not jokes. As time after time my mom enters my room and be disgusted at different parts of my body by shouting out how they are fat, and as I was talking about how I like a character from a movie she suddenly starts criticizing my face—thick neck, fat head, and big ears—I started to feel upset but did not oppose her directly. I would simply ignore her.

By the time I finally spoke up to her it was three years later. We got into a fight because of trivial matters, and it quickly turned into a conflict where she started bringing up things I did wrong in the past and I started to do the same. I texted her the phrases that she used to repeatedly call me, but sadly she went on only to say that I deserve these phrases and they suit me well. I talked about body shaming and how we should first love our bodies. She said I was unhealthy. I told her not to judge other people, whether it was their body shapes or their facial features. She said clothes she bought six years ago can’t fit me anymore because I grew fat.

I felt like a nerd. Not only because of the words my mom said, but because I used to give speeches in front of the whole school talking about Toni Morrison’s self-regard and Chizuko Ueno’s feminist perspectives especially in East Asian societies; I used to persuade students to write about social issues like body shaming and cyber bullying for the school magazine and yearbook. Now I was attacked by my own mother and could not find a way out.

When I finally was able to speak up and told my dad about the phrases she said to me, I saw on his face a faint laugh and how he quickly forced the tip of his mouth to drop down and acted as if he did not laugh. My dad told me what she did was wrong, and I questioned whether there was a justification for her actions. He said my mom had low levels of education, so she could not worry about my studies and thus could only care about my meals and outer appearances. Now, despite all the criticisms my mom had had towards my body, my previous emotions were suddenly aroused by another layer of emotions: feminist instinctive protections and justifications towards my mom for she was blamed for only being able to care for the insignificant things around the family. I was stuck in a position either to retort the long-term humiliation that my mom has made towards me or to defend her for being able to care for me because she is my mother.

When I finally talked to her about it I still didn’t have the courage to express my emotions directly. I was on the subway in Shanghai. I showed her a picture of a manga character sticker that I put on the back of my phone. The character has a lot of piercings on his ear, wears cool punk clothes, and is thin. I asked my mom whether she thinks that the character looked cool. My mom at first didn’t care to look at the character and muttered some perfunctory words and turned her head to face the other side. I asked again. She casted a glance at the character for what seemed to be like 0.1 second and smeared and said, “You wouldn’t look good on this because of your thick neck and large ears and fat face.” At that instant all of my anger that had been accumulating bursted out inside. I didn’t answer my mom and turned back to my phone.

It was similar to a lot of things that my mom had done. In third grade I attended a programming class. I was a new student who didn’t know anyone except for one boy. I remember standing beside the classroom when he told the other students that “this ugly person is the new student.” It was again in English class when he shouted, in front of the whole class, “why are you so ugly.” When my mom picked me up and when I told her about it, she joked, “well, I do admit you are ugly.” The young me didn’t know what to say. Funnily, the old me didn’t either.

Note: I did not check grammar, so there will be some grammar mistakes.
