description: Thinking back on my 17 and a half years of life, I feel so ordinary and exhausted.
toc: true
---

回想我17年半的人生，感觉自己过得是如此普通又乏累。我们没有河南河北考生的国度内卷，却仍然是全中国本科线最高的省之一。我们更没有背景上海考生的自由与愉快。我唯独真正快乐、无忧无虑的时光大致停留在了小学一二年级。小学二年级时我们搬家了，离开了以前的小区（我们称作南苑），搬到了学校隔壁的小区。幼儿园时，南苑是母亲上班的地方，是我和表哥、公公婆婆（即外公外婆）、舅舅舅母、还有妈妈的朋友、我的朋友居住的地方。那是一个大大的几乎五脏俱全的员工家属小区，走在院子里的小道上，仿佛大家都互相认识。出个门、上个坡、进单车棚，哪里都能看见熟人。

Thinking back on my 17 and a half years of life, I feel so ordinary and exhausted. We do not have the over-“involution” of college entrance exams in provinces like Henan and Hebei, but we are still one of the provinces with the highest exam grade boundaries in China. Of course, we do not have the freedom and happiness of Shanghai or Beijing examinees. The time when I can be truly happy and carefree roughly ended in first or second grades of elementary school. When I was in second grade of elementary, we moved. We left the previous community (we called it Nanyuan, an apartment complex) and moved to an apartment right next to the elementary school. In kindergarten, Nanyuan was where my mother worked, and where I lived with my cousin, grandparents, uncles and aunts, and my mother’s friends and my friends. It was a large community of employees’ family members. Almost everything you need is in that large apartment complex. My mom used to go to elementary in the community. There is a small theater, a building for the company employees, a cafeteria, several ponds, a lot of trees and plants and small gardens. The list can go on. Walking on the path in the apartment complex, it seemed like everyone knew each other. You can see acquaintances everywhere you go.

小时候我会哭着喊着不愿意去上幼儿园。幼儿园里我吃饭最慢，等其他小朋友排排坐开始看电视时我还罚站在最后一排，手里端着还剩半碗的米饭，艰难地一勺一勺往嘴里送，或是拿着永远吃不完的千层糕，一层一层撕下来小口小口地慢吞吞地咀嚼着。幼儿园的老师们夸我聪明，可是老师们不知道的是我既不是绝顶聪明，也除了聪明、安静、乖巧之外仿佛一无是处。幼儿园表演时，我站在舞台上，脸上画着红艳艳的妆，额头中央点着一个红红的小圆圈，短短的头发被硬生生地抓起一撮用带着扎人的亮片的皮筋缠了起来。我眼睛直直地望着台下的家长们，在其他小朋友一齐向前迈出第一个动作时，我却不知为何迈不动脚了，站在舞台中央放声大哭起来，然后跌跌撞撞地跑下了舞台。

When I was a child, I would cry and yell to not wanting to go to kindergarten. I ate the slowest for every breakfast and lunch in kindergarten. When other children sat in rows and started watching cartoons on TV, I were to stand in the last row with half a bowl of rice in my hand, struggling to put it into my mouth spoon by spoon. The food I hated the most, however, was the “million-fold” cake, which, joked by my grandparents, could never be finished eating by me as I would tear it off layer by layer and chew slowly. The teachers in kindergarten praised me for being smart, but what the teachers didn’t know was that I was neither extremely smart, nor seemed to have any merits other than being a tiny bit clever, quiet, and well-behaved. When our class in the kindergarten was performing, I stood on the stage with bright makeup on my face, a small red dot dropped by a lip stick in the center of my forehead, and a bunch of tangled short hair that was abruptly grabbed by a rubber band with piercing sequins. I looked down straight at the parents in the audience. When the other children took the first move forward, for some reason, I couldn’t move my feet. I stood in the middle of the stage and burst into tears, then stumbled and ran off the stage. In kindergarten, I was not afraid. I would cry on stage and would not fear what others think. Until I suddenly realized that in kindergarten kids already have a sense of humiliation. It shaped me into years of being afraid of performing or even talking in front of others, caring about what others think, and trying exhaustingly to keep my self image in front of the public.

我的一生围绕着水。水分开了我的城市，却又把它环绕住、拥抱住，好若一双手捧起这座老城。连接着城市两头的是水，可把它们分开的也是水。在水上，人们搭建了浮桥。浮桥是由众多木质船只和木板组合而成的，它漂浮在水上，和水融为一体。走在浮桥上，桥身随脚步晃动。在一块块几乎被磨光的木板上，是水的印记。浮桥随着江水呼吸的起伏而起伏着，不断地顺应着江水生命的韵律，仿佛水赋予了浮桥以生命、支撑着它的生命，也给予了它生命的意义。古城的城墙脚下还是水。流动的、温柔的江水旁边矗立着威严的灰黑石板砌成的城墙，在单调的静态建筑物中带来了一丝生机和活跃。这也是这座城市的生活方式：安宁如江水静悄悄地流淌一般，时而的喧闹如水纹不断向前。

My whole life revolves around water. Water separates my city, but still it surrounds and embraces it, as if holding the old city with both hands. It is water that connects the two ends of the city, but it is also water that separates them. On the water, people built pontoons. The pontoon bridge is composed of many wooden boats and planks. It floats on the water and blends with it. Walking on the pontoon bridge, the bridge body shakes with people’s footsteps. On the almost worn out and wooden boards, there are imprints of water. The pontoon bridge rises and falls with the breath of the river, constantly conforming to the rhythm of life in the river, as if the water endows the pontoon with life, supports its life, and also gives it the meaning of life. There is also water at the foot of the ancient city walls. Next to the flowing and gentle river water stands a majestic city wall made of gray and black stone slabs, bringing vitality and dynamic to the monotonous static buildings. This is also the way of life in this city: tranquil like the river flowing quietly and occasional bustles like the water rippling.

很小很小的时候，我住在奶奶家。奶奶家就在章江隔壁，下楼、过马路边来到了江边。横跨章江的有一座飞龙大桥。小时候，奶奶为了喊我起床，便告诉我说大桥上住着一只会飞的小龙，每天六点钟都会从桥里飞走。再大一点，我住到了大院里。大院内处处可见的也是水：有里面放着假山、蝌蚪游来游去的大池塘，在我和哥哥经常爬上去的小树下面有小池塘，还有到了晚上会变色的喷泉。暑假时，我和朋友便去爬树、抓蝌蚪。手伸进池塘的水中，蝌蚪便从我们手指间穿过，小尾巴的摆动带动着水的舞动，可爱极了。再次把蝌蚪放回池塘里便是当它们前后脚长出的时候。不久，它们便会变成一只只小青蛙。在水中，我们看见了生命的孕育。

When I was very young, I lived at my grandma’s apartment. Grandma’s apartment is next door to Zhangjiang, one of the two rivers that embrace Ganzhou. Walking downstairs and crossing the road, I would arrive at the riverside. There is a Feilong Bridge (in English, it translates to “Flying-Dragon Bridge”) across the part of Zhangjiang River near my grandma’s apartment. When I was young, my grandma told me that there was a little flying dragon living on the bridge in order to wake me up in the morning, and it would fly away from the bridge at six o’clock every day. When I was a little older, I lived in an apartment complex. Water can be seen everywhere in the complex: there is a large pond with fake rock mountains and tadpoles swimming around, there is a small pond under the small tree that my brother and I often climb up, and there is a fountain that changes color and dances at night. During summer vacation, my friends and I would climb trees and catch tadpoles. When we put our hands into the water of the pond, the tadpoles passed through our fingers, and the swing of the small tail drove the dancing of the water. We would return the tadpoles to the pond again when their front and rear legs have grown out. Soon, they will turn into little frogs. In the water, we see the birth of life.

可是我好讨厌水。因为水仿佛能包容一切世间的好坏，因为水太纯洁太朴实它能将当我走在江边，看着我在水中映出的倒影时，我看到的是我内心的愧疚和慌张。小时候，我们除了捉蝌蚪之外，还会把石头砸进喷泉里，再看着一束高高的水柱喷出、一层层水花散开。我们最怕的是一个骑着三轮车吹着口哨的老爷爷。他戴着帽子，留着到脖子长度的头发，身穿背心和短裤。我们向喷泉里扔石头时他总是会经过，用他戴着口音的话朝着我们大喊，我们便落荒而逃。我们还喜欢做其他恶作剧：用不同药物和做菜要用的调味料混合在一起做成毒药倒进蚂蚁窝里，再用随手捡起的小树枝将蚂蚁窝的土和毒药搅拌在一起。

But I hated water so much, because water seems to be able to contain all the good and bad in the world without any complaint, and because water is so pure and simple that when I walked by the river and looked at my reflection in the water, saw guilt and panic in my heart. When I was young, in addition to catching tadpoles, we would throw stones into the fountain, and then watch tall water jets spray out and layers of water spread out. What we were most afraid of was an old man on a tricycle and whistles when he rides across the apartment complex. He was wearing a hat, white tank top, and shorts, and he has neck-length curly hair. We didn’t know what kind of jon he has. Maybe it was buying reusable trash from families living in the apartment complex. He would pass by when we threw rocks into the fountain and yell at us with his accented Chinese, and we would run away. We also liked to do other pranks: mix different medicines and seasonings for cooking to make “poison” and pour it into ant nests, and then stir the poison and the soil of the ant nest with twigs we picked up casually. We would laugh and observe how ants are running around overwhelmingly.

水是一面镜子，也是一口记忆皿，站在江边，水流声好似翻动着我记忆的声音，将我的惭愧全都翻出来，一点一点沉落在不可磨灭的江底。家里的木地板由于漏水全都进了水，木地板被一块一块地卸了下来，叠在旁边，成天被一个转着脑袋的电风扇吹来吹去。一名工人来我们家铺回木地板去，带着他的好几个女儿。铺地板花了两三天时间，前几天我一直待在房间里，没有见到那几个小女孩，只是听见了小女孩的声音。爸爸跟我说：“你看人家小朋友都在帮家长干活。”最后一天时，一阵陌生的敲门声响起后我去开门，便看见了两个二三年级的小姑娘站在门口。她们可是惊讶了：原来这家里还有个姐姐，特别高兴地想和我玩。于是我给她们端了两张凳子放在客厅，她们便坐着一个接一个地为我唱歌，我也为她们鼓掌。之后我和她们趴在客厅的地板上画画。我打开了那个两三年都没开启的画笔盒子，上面沾满了灰尘，水粉颜料变得硬邦邦的。她们让我画一个抱着小猫的小女孩、冰淇凌、手，和我玩文字游戏，相互告诉自己的名字。她们告诉我她们不是赣州人，而是别的城市来的，爸爸妈妈在赣州打工。在她们老家，家里有一只猫咪会抓老鼠。最后，她们让我画一个彩虹，画的时候已经是午饭时间了，她们被她们的爸爸叫走回家吃午饭了。我趴在地上，用油画棒草草地画了一个彩虹，将相邻的两种颜色稍微过渡了一番。下午我听见她们进我们家的声音，听见她们问“姐姐去哪里啦？”，听见她们趴在地上打开画笔盒画画。我爸爸对她们说我在睡午觉，其实我从来都没有睡午觉这个习惯，此时此刻，我只是待在我的房间里看着电影罢了。我不知懂为什么那个中午她们再次来到我们家时我不出去见她们、和她们一起玩。初中时我们老师经常会带自己的小孩来学校，我也经常逗他们玩，甚至还有同学对我说“你以后应该很适合当妈妈吧”。高中时我在一个名叫长腿叔叔信箱做志愿者，主要是和小学的孩子用信沟通。和小朋友的沟通也让我十分欣慰，时而能抚平我浮躁的心，让我重新回到童年。之后，我听见她们和她们的爸爸离开的声音，地板已经铺好了，她们也不会再来我们家了。我走出我的房间，看见地上孤零零的画纸，画纸又多了一道彩虹，那是小女孩们画的。那个彩虹大大的，颜色涂得不均匀，不同颜色之间也没有过渡，还留有空白。彩虹的旁边写了一行字：子涵姐姐，这是我画的彩虹。那一刻我特别愧疚，仿佛那道彩虹正是毫无遮挡地映出了我波澜的心情。

Water is a mirror as well as a Pensieve (memory dish). Standing by the river, the sound of water flowing seems to stir my memory, revealing all my guilt and sinking them to the bottom of the river. The wooden floors in our apartment were flooded with water due to water leaks. They were removed piece by piece and stacked on top of each other. The empty floor, revealing its original gray cement was blown back and forth by an electric fan that turned its head all day long. A worker came to our apartment to put back the wooden floors and took two of his younger daughters with him. It took three days to install back the wooden floors. I stayed in my room for the first few days when they were in the living room working and didn’t see the little girls but only heard their voices when their father told them to pack up to leave. My father told me,“These little girls are helping their dad with work.” On the last day, I answered the door after a strange series of loud knockings, and saw two little girls in the second and third grades standing at the door. The  two girls were surprised: it turned out that there was a big sister in this family. They were very happy and wanted to play with me. I brought them two stools in the living room, and they sat and sang for me one after another, and I applauded for them. Afterwards, we laid down on the floor drew pictures. I opened the stationary case that hadn’t been opened for three years, and it was covered with dust. The gouache was already hardened. They asked me to draw a little girl holding a kitten, ice cream, and hands. They played word games with me, and we told each other our names—exchanging some part of our identity and placing trust in each other. The girls told me that they are not from Ganzhou, but from another city, and their parents are working in Ganzhou as laborers. In their small house back in their hometown, there is a cat that could catch mice. In the end, they asked me to draw a rainbow. It was lunch time when I finally started drawing it, but their father came and told them to leave for lunch. I laid down on the floor and quickly sketched a rainbow with oil pastel, slightly blending adjacent colors. In the afternoon, I heard the two girls’ voices when they enter our home. I heard them asking “where did the big sister go.” I heard them lying on the ground and opening the stationary boxes to draw. But I didn’t want to step out of my room. My dad told the girls I was taking a nap, but I never had the habit of taking a nap. I was merely staying in my room and watching a movie. I don’t know why I didn’t go out to meet them and play with them when they came to our house again that afternoon. When we were in middle school, our teachers would often bring their own children to school, and I would often tease them. One of my classmates even said to me, “You would be a very suitable mother in the future.” I don’t really agree with it. I am merely a playmate of the children. When I was in high school, I worked as a volunteer at a mailbox called Daddy Long Legs, mainly communicating with elementary school children by letter. The communication with children makes me very gratified. Sometimes it can soothe my impetuous heart and bring me back to my childhood. A few hours later, I heard them leaving. The wooden floor was brand new, and they would never come to our home again. I walked out of my room and saw the lonely drawing paper on the floor. There was another rainbow on the drawing paper, drawn by little girls. The rainbow was big, but the colors were not evenly painted. There were blank spaces between adjacent colors. A line of words was written next to the rainbow: Sister Zihan, this is the rainbow I drew. Hope you like it. At that moment, I felt very guilty, as if that rainbow reflected clearly my turbulent mood filled with regret. I put the paper and the stationary box back in the dusty drawer and wondered when will be the next time some else would open it.

水隔离了这座城，使得这座城如此的平凡和不起眼。我是多么厌倦这蜿蜒地环绕着这座城的江水。我讨厌这座城。我讨厌她闷热的夏天和没有雪却依然寒冷的冬天，讨厌她连最大的商场里也没有星巴克和无印良品，讨厌她没有好玩的游乐场，讨厌她小小的机场没有国际航班，讨厌她如沉睡般的宁静。我讨厌自己出生于这座城。

Water isolates the city, making the city so ordinary and inconspicuous. Tired of the river winding around the city, I hated it. I hated her sweltering summer and cold winter without snow; I hated that she doesn’t even have Starbucks and Muji in the biggest shopping mall; I hated that she doesn’t have a fun amusement park; I hated her small airport without international flights; I hate her peacefulness.

我小时候经常生病，每次都是去妇幼保健院找同一个医生。医院旁是一个叫钓鱼台的小巷，里面手游不同的小吃：玉米汁、肠粉、清汤（即比馄炖皮更薄、比馄炖更小的东西）、豆腐脑、还有时而出现的新疆馕饼。即便没有生病，那里也是我小时候每周的必去之地。每周末早晨，妈妈骑着电动车载着我去钓鱼题啊，享受一份美味的早餐。我经常去的是一家肠粉店。起先肠粉的蒸笼是摆在路边的，老板娘又韵律地前后拉动着不同层的蒸盘，白色的米浆倒入盘内，点缀着淡淡地鸡蛋液和少许肉末。白乎乎的整齐围绕在蒸笼四周，米浆凝固起来，再随着老板娘手中的刮刀一点一点生起了皱纹，卷了起来。端出来的肠粉上撒满了切碎的绿葱和土色的萝卜干，浸在一片酱油里。小时候，我最喜欢的配料之一就是萝卜干。咬下去时硬邦邦的，再咀嚼两口变成了甜甜的，十分有嚼劲。肠粉店的对面经常坐着一个卖豆腐脑的老奶奶。她的装备十分简朴：一根竹竿和两个木桶，其中一个木桶里装的是白花花、软软的豆腐脑，另一个则是装了酱油、葱、姜、辣椒等调料。老奶奶每次坐在一个阴暗狭小的小道理，将两个木桶摆在外面，自己却仿佛要融入那阳光照不进来的阴暗之处。我一般先去老奶奶那里端一碗咸豆腐脑，再点上一份肠粉。来往多了，我和老奶奶也自然熟了，我们简单的寒暄，买完豆腐脑后便坐在她准备的小凳子上，用木桶当桌子。她矮小的、瘦弱的身躯便坐在我对面，好似在家里吃饭一般，温暖和快乐。后来随着我们搬家，我的生活渐渐远离了老城区。昔日丰富和温暖的早餐被替换成一片又一片无味的杂粮面包。我也很少再出去吃早餐，自己出门变成了再手机上点外卖让别人送上门。与此同时，那种和陌生人面对面时不经意的温馨也渐渐飘散了。

I was often sick when I was a child, and every time I went to the Maternal and Child Health Hospital to see the same doctor. Next to the hospital is an alley called Diaoyutai, which holds various snack shops selling different snacks: corn juice, rice rolls, “clear soup” (similar to wonton but has a skin thinner than wonton skin and a size smaller than wonton), tofu pudding, and even Uyghur bread. Even when I wasn’t sick, it was my weekly go-to place as a kid. Every weekend morning, my mother would ride an electric scooter and take me to Diaoyutai to enjoy a delicious breakfast. I often go to a rice roll shop. In the beginning, the rice roll steamer was placed on the side of the alley, and the owner would rhythmically pull the different steaming plates back and forth, pour white rice mixture into the plate, and dot with light egg liquid and a little minced meat. White steam neatly surrounded the steamer. With the rice milk solidified, the owner would wrinkle the skin of the rice roll with the spatula and roll it up. Rice rolls arrive at the table sprinkled with chopped green onions and earth-colored dried radishes, doused in a dollop of soy sauce. As a kid, one of my favorite ingredients was dried radishes. When you take the first bit, it is quite hard. However, it becomes sweet and chewy after a few more bites. Across the rice roll shop, there often sits an old lady selling tofu pudding sitting. Her equipment is very simple: a bamboo pole and two wooden barrels, one of which is filled with soft, white tofu pudding, and the other is filled with soy sauce, chopped green onions, ginger, pepper and other seasonings. Every time, the old lady sat in a small, dark gap in between two buildings with the two wooden barrels outside, as if trying to blend herself into darkness. For my breakfast routine, I usually go to her to buy a bowl of salted tofu pudding first and then order a rice roll. As I often appear every weekend with the same routine, the old lady and I are gradually getting more acquainted. We exchanged simple greetings, and after buying tofu pudding, I would sit on the small stool she prepared and use the wooden barrel as a table. Her short, thin body sat across from me, smiling and watching me eat as if I were eating at home, warm and happy. Later, as we moved, my life gradually moved away from the old city. The rich and warm breakfast of the past was replaced by slice after slice of tasteless multigrain bread. I seldom go out for breakfast. Instead of going out by myself, I order takeaway on my phone and get it delivered to my door. At the same time, the accidental warmth of meeting strangers gradually faded away.

我的童年只能用寻常来形容。和别的小朋友一样，我上着普通的课外班：书法、下棋、钢琴，却一个接一个地被我放弃了。我没有耐心面对妈妈对我写的七歪八扭的毛笔字的辱骂后放弃了书法；我得了近视，却不知道也不敢和妈妈说，于是看琴谱时要不断地移前琴凳，把脸凑在琴谱前面才看得清，可这种不标准的姿势却令老师和妈妈不满意，于是放弃了钢琴；在幼儿园，当我面对对对手束手无策时，一怒之下推翻了棋盘，所有棋子都洒落在地面，于是放弃了下棋。唯独画画，一个通往色彩和想象的世界的道路，算我断断续续的爱好。可随着初三每天早上七点到晚上十点、一周六天的学校，我也再无时间训练我画画的基本功了，只能在课堂无聊的时候在草稿本上乱涂一番。后来初高中衔接的暑假，我喜欢上了捣鼓手工：缝纫、刺绣、钩针等等，但随着开学，一卷一卷的毛线和绣针也被遗忘在角落里。

My childhood can only be described as ordinary. Like other children, I took ordinary extracurricular classes: calligraphy, Chinese chess, and piano, but I gave them up one by one. I didn’t have the patience to face my mother’s insults to my crooked calligraphy and gave up calligraphy; I was short-sighted, but I didn’t know and didn’t dare to tell my mother, so I had to keep moving towards the piano sheet to see clearly, but this non-standard posture made the teacher and mother dissatisfied, so I gave up the piano; after being faced with a helpless situation, I swiped the chessboard off from the table, and all the pieces fell to the ground, so I gave up playing chess. Only painting, an escape to the world of color and imagination, can count as my intermittent hobby. However, with a school schedule from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM, six days a week, in ninth grade, I no longer have time to practice my basic drawing skills. I can only scribble on the sketchbook when I am bored in class. Later, during the summer vacation between middle school and high school, I fell in love with making handcrafts: sewing, embroidery, crochet, etc., but as high school started, the rolls of wool and embroidery needles were forgotten in the corner.

赣州的水是安静的，比起长江的壮观或是黄河的汹涌澎湃，它只是沉寂地流淌过这座城，在夜晚的风吹过时低声细语着。如这寂静的水一样，我不喜欢夸张化、戏剧化我的世界。它只是千千万万个普通人的生活。我的爷爷奶奶太爷爷太奶奶没有传奇的人生。我的太爷爷太奶奶一辈子待在乡村，是乡下的农民，在老家拉着牛面朝黄土背朝天地种田。他们亲手搭建的老家的土胚房至今还站立在那里，我爷爷的哥哥现在依然住在那儿。我奶奶虽然读完了高中，却因为文革的原因无法上大学。后来，她便在工厂里每天做着重复的工作。我奶奶的其他兄弟姐妹没有读上高中，只能在乡下种田。我奶奶的哥哥在几十年前因为当工人而得肺结核去世了。我爷爷年轻的时候当过兵，不过没有上过战场，回来之后便在办公室里工作。若要说我奶奶优秀之处的话，则是她的多才多艺和勤勤恳恳。奶奶会织毛线，钩针，缝衣服，编鞋垫，当然，还会做一手好菜。高中时，我奶奶是学校篮球队队员，听她说，篮球队每天早上都要早起锻炼，绕着他们的县城跑一圈再回学校吃早饭。从出生以来，我奶奶便天天陪伴在我身边，替我换尿布，喂我吃东西，帮我洗澡，给我煮饭。如今，我每周回奶奶家吃一顿她为全家人做的饭菜。他们没有颠簸的人生，没有令外人大吃一惊的人生，他们只是像大多数在这座城里的人一样普普通通地生活着。

The water in Ganzhou is quiet, compared to the grandeur of the Yangtze River or the turbulence of the Yellow River, it merely flows through the city silently, whispering when the night wind blows. Like this still water, I don’t like to exaggerate and dramatize my world. It is the life of billions of ordinary people. My grandparents and great grandparents have no legendary life. My great-grandfather and great-grandmother stayed in the rural area all their lives. They were farmers. The adobe house in their hometown they built with their own hands is still standing, and my grandpa’s brothers and relatives still live there. Although my grandma finished high school, she couldn’t go to college because of the Cultural Revolution. Later, she worked in the factory every day. My grandma’s other siblings didn’t go to high school and could only farm in the rural area. My grandma’s older brother died of tuberculosis decades ago as a laborer. My grandfather was a soldier for a few years but he never went to the battlefield. After he came back, he worked in an office. What made my grandma outstanding is her versatility and hard work. Grandma can knit, crochet, sew clothes, weave insoles, and, of course, cook. When she was in high school, my grandma was a member of the school basketball team. The basketball team had to wake up early every morning to exercise, which includes running around their county town before going back to school for breakfast. Since I was born, my grandma has been by my side every day, changing my diapers, feeding me, bathing me, and cooking for me. Now, I go back to my grandma’s house once a week for a meal she cooks for the whole family.

我的城市也像他们普通的存在着。我刚出生时，新城甚至还是一片片的平坦的荒地，只有零零散散还在施工的楼盘。整座城市只有唯一的百货中心和超市，连一个像样的商场也没有。那时候的赣州甚至比现在的小县城还要破旧。我亲眼看见一座又一座的商场在赣州开张，过去的人眼稀少变成了如今的人山人爱。一座商场在我小时候的小区旁平地而起。可水是多变的，是不断地流淌着的。如水一样，随着赣州的逐渐繁华，老城的样子也变了。破旧的郁孤台、龟角尾、古城墙翻了新，在褪色了的墙壁上刷上了一层又一层崭新、鲜亮而又刺眼的尤其。原本空无一物的古城墙上放满了红黄色印刷的军旗。在古城墙前，商业街见了起来，琳琅的商品——烤肠、糍粑、租借汉服、烧烤——摆在小摊前面，一眼望去却毫无特色。90年代繁华的标准钟处如今店铺已空荡荡得不见人影，店门的牌子早已拆下，店内黑漆漆的只剩下灰尘和时间的痕迹。而那条小吃街——那个充满人家烟火和温情的小吃街也消失在街道里，变成了“网红食物”的聚集地。卖豆腐脑的老奶奶也隐匿在茫茫人群中。我还记得她矮小瘦弱的身板，肩上挑着一根长长的竹竿，上面吊着两个大大的木桶，一摇一摆地穿梭在人群中，一下就不见了身影。儿时我们在水中嬉戏的时光一去不复返，就连儿时的玩伴也分道扬镳了。我们搬了家，过去大家都互相认识、和亲戚朋友住一起、有公园、有喷泉、有我和朋友的秘密基地的小区变成了陌生的、只有一栋栋住宅楼的小区。童年就像骑着三轮车一样，咯噔咯噔地离我越来越远。

My city also exists ordinarily like them. When I was born, the new part of the city was still a piece of flat wasteland, with only scattered buildings under construction. There is only one department store and supermarket in the whole city. It didn’t have a decent shopping mall. I saw with my own eyes shopping malls opening in Ganzhou one after another. What used to be a sparsely populated area has become a popular place today. A shopping mall was built on the ground right next to the apartment complex where I grew up. Water, as it embeds into the city, is changeable and constantly flowing. Like water, with the gradual prosperity of Ganzhou, the appearance of the old city has also changed. The dilapidated Yugu Pavilion, Guijiaowei Park, and the ancient city walls have been refurbished, and layers of new, bright, and dazzling paint have been covered on the faded walls. The originally empty ancient city wall was filled with red and yellow printed military flags. In front of the ancient city wall, a commercial shopping street appeared, and a wide range of unremarkable products – grilled sausages, rice cakes, rented Hanfu, barbecue – were placed in front of the small stalls. Near the Standard Clock, where it used to be a bustling market place filled with different types of shops, now stands lonely in the middle of abandoned, empty stores. The signs on the door of the stores have long been removed, and the inside of the store is dark, leaving only dust and traces of time. And Diaoyutai, the snack street full of warmth also disappeared in the street and became a gathering place for “influencer food”. I still remember the old lady who sells tofu pudding. Her short and thin body, barely able to withstand the weight of the two large wooden barrels hanging loosely from the long bamboo pole, swayed through the crowd and disappeared. Gone are the days when we played in the water as children, and even our childhood playmates have parted ways. We moved, and the apartment complex where everyone knew each other, where we lived with relatives and friends, and where it had parks, fountains, and secret bases for me and my friends turned into a smaller complex with only residential buildings arranged neatly in rows. My childhood was riding a tricycle, gradually getting farther and farther away from me.

小时候，小区就是我们的游乐场。出了抓蝌蚪、荡秋千，我们还会摘桂花、采掉在地上的白玉兰、爬树、建造秘密基地、埋葬小鸟、夏天时在树上找到知了蜕下的壳别再衣服上、绕着小道爬过围栏去游泳······可这些早已变成了过去。如今的池塘被填成了停车场，夜晚会发光并且跳出不一样的舞姿的喷泉如今压满了汽车。小时候，我们的秘密基地是一个小树丛，中间横跨着一棵倒下的大树，而现在，那棵大树随着小树丛一起消失了。取而代之的是我的新小区。小区跨度很小，从这一头到那一头只有400米不到，横跨着也只有100米左右。小区内单调地摆放着四栋矮楼，楼与楼之间原本的草地和小树今年也被改造成了灰不溜秋的停车场。不断地逝去，不断地逝去，就像现在小区里的大树一样，每到冬末春初时叶子落得一片也不剩，枝干孤零零的尴尬地竖在空中，而到春暮时，叶子开始发芽，过了一两周便从只露尖角的嫩芽变成淡绿的小叶子。但是不像小区大树的树叶一样会不停地年复一年地更换，这座城不变的是她的人，她的血液，她的枝干和她的根脉。

When we were young, the apartment complex was our playground. In addition to catching tadpoles and swinging, we would also pick sweet olive flowers that grew right in front of my building, pick magnolias that fell on the ground, climb trees, build secret bases, bury birds, find shells of cicadas on trees in summer and pin them on our clothes, explore secret trails, and climb over the fence to the hotel next door to swim. These are long gone. Now, the ponds are filled cement and are turned into parking lots. The fountains that glow at night and perform different dances are now squashed with cars. When we were kids, our secret place was a grove of trees with a big tree trunk across it. The tree has now disappeared along with the grove. In place of our wonderland is a new, smaller apartment complex. It is less than 400 meters from one end to the other and only about 100 meters across. There are four low buildings monotonously placed in the complex, and the grass and small trees that was originally placed in between the buildings have also been transformed into a gray parking lot this summer. Like the big trees in front of the complex, where at the end of each winter and early spring, leaves fall down, and the branches stand awkwardly in the air alone, my life and the things in my life keep passing away. However, at the end of each spring, the leaves begin to sprout. After a week or two, the buds turn into small light green leaves. Unlike the leaves of the big trees, which are constantly replaced year after year, my life does not get replaced or rewinded. Nor does the city itself has a way of returning to its past. However, what remains unchanged in this city is her people, her blood, her branches, and her roots.

长大了，我自己也逐渐远离我的城市，每隔半年 回到这座悠闲宁静的小城，重新走过老城的小巷和古城墙，踏上浮桥，漫游江边，耳闻江水细细地倾诉着她这半年以来的变化。好如环绕着她三面的江水一般，这座城的表面时多变的。对于为数不多的旅客来说，他们眼中的赣州只是千面万面江水中的一面而已。而在我眼中，赣州就是那变化的江水，我目睹并经历着她缓缓地向着远方流动，又从远方流淌过来。

As I grew up, I gradually moved away from my city. Returning to this quiet town every six months, I would walk through the alleys and ancient city walls of the old city, stray across the pontoon bridge, roam along the river, and hear the river slowly whispering about her changes in the past six months. Like the river that surrounds the city on three sides, the city’s surface is ever-changing. For the very few tourists, the Ganzhou in their eyes is merely one of the river’s thousands of faces. In my eyes, Ganzhou is the changing river. I have witnessed and experienced her flowing slowly towards the distance, and flowing from the distance.

身处外地的时候，我第一次像一个陌生的旅客一样在网络上搜索“赣州”二字，翻动着关于她的页面，浏览者那些再熟悉不过的美食。我惊讶地发现，我竟没有一次用相机好好地拍过赣州，于是只能痛苦地靠着零碎的、褪了色的记忆支撑起我对她的幻想。我一次又一次打开地图，尝试通过哪些单调的色块中找到身临其境的感觉。我一遍又一遍寻找郁孤台、古城墙、灶儿巷的位置，将它们输入进起点与终点，想象着沿途的店铺和景色。我会想起我过去多么厌倦这座城。可知道那时候我才知道她早已深深地印在了我的内心和我的人生里。我成为了她，她成为了我。我是她不可缺少的一部分，她也是我不可缺失的一部分。风儿拂过，我想起的是她。我想，在这风儿吹来的路上，曾经和章江的水打过照面，和古城墙石砖上的青苔握过小手，最好也吹进我的窗中，打乱已经放下的窗帘，带来奶奶的烧皮肉，姨奶奶的荷包胙的味道。还有可能，这风儿带来了郁孤台下赣江的流水，中间多少行人的眼泪。

While studying in another city, I searched for the word “Ganzhou” on the internet like a traveler for the first time, flipped through web pages about her, and browsed the familiar pictures posted on the Internet that are too blurry. I was surprised to find that I had never taken a good picture of Ganzhou with a camera, so I could only rely on fragmented and faded memories to support my fantasy of her. I opened the map again and again, trying to find an immersive feeling through those monotonous color blocks. I searched for the locations of Yugu Pavilion, the ancient city wall, and Zaoer Alley over and over again, entered them into the starting point and the destination to see the route connection them together, and imagined the shops and scenery along the way. I would think of how tired I was of the city. But only then did I know that she has already been deeply imprinted in my heart and my life. I became her and she became me. I am an integral part of her and she is an integral part of me. The wind blows, and I think of her. As the wind touches my skin, I thought, she must have also met the water of Zhangjiang River and shook hands with the moss on the stone bricks of the ancient city wall, bringing with her the taste of grandma’s roasted meat. The wind may have also brought the water of the Ganjiang River under Yugutai and the tears of many pedestrians that went pass.

水也造就了这座城，和城市融为一体。埋在老城地下的福寿沟从宋代开始到现在一直默默地保护着她，阻挡着赣江的洪水，好如大树的根一样，扎根在这座老城里面，不离不弃。就像这座城一样，赣州的桂花也十分低调。一朵朵小小的淡黄的花瓣藏匿在油绿的光亮的树叶后面，一点也不招摇。童年时的我们喜欢采桂花，将一小簇一小簇的黄花捧在手心里，让她们甜甜的香气留下，再将她们抛向空中，洒落成一阵桂花雨。我们还尝试做过桂花香水，将采摘下的桂花放进一小罐水中，放上几天，结果不仅没有做成桂花香水，还变成臭臭的馊馊的水了，只好作罢。关于桂花的故事我没有太多，因为她总是充当着那个不起眼的背景，或者我童年快乐回忆的载体。她的花香蕴含着她多年在学校看守着我们、等待着我们的时光。她总是默默无闻地、身影都不愿意露出地让风儿带走她的花香。

Water also created the city and blended with the city. Fushougou, a drainage system that has over 1000 years of history, buried underground in the old city, has been silently protecting her from the Song Dynasty to the present, blocking the flood of the two rivers. Like the roots of a big tree, it is rooted in the old city. Like this city, Ganzhou’s sweet olives also keep a low profile. The small pale yellow petals are hidden behind the shiny green leaves, which are not ostentatious at all. When we were children, we liked to pick sweet olive flowers. We held small clusters of yellow flowers in the palm of our hands, let their sweet fragrance stay, and then threw them into the air to form a rain of sweet olives. We also tried to make sweet olive perfume. We would put the picked petals of sweet olives into a small pot of water and left it for a few days. As a result, not only did we not make sweet-scented perfume, but it turned into stinky rotten water, so we had to give up. I don’t have too many stories about sweet olives, because she always acts as the humble background or the carrier of my happy childhood memories. Her floral fragrance contains the years of her watching over us and waiting for us at school, and she always let the wind carry away her fragrance but unwilling to reveal her true figure.

艾米果也是这座城特有的美食之一，和它的名字一样，艾米果是用艾草做成的米果。艾草首先要切得很碎，和粉混合在一起，揉成一个绿色的面团，然后再像包饺子一样用面团把馅料包起来。小时候我的婆婆会亲自在清明节的时候做艾米果，我们也会亲手去草地里采艾草。那时候我们还小，不能用大大的菜刀剁碎艾草，所以只能看着婆婆“噔噔噔”有节奏地将一片一片分离的艾草切碎成一团绿绿的糊糊。之后，我的婆婆也不再做艾米果了。清明节本来每年会回的老家也渐渐变得陌生，不再曾见面了。最后一次做艾米果还是在老家。大家聚在一起做艾米果，我和其他的小朋友却像捏粘土一样玩艾米果的面团，等不及了的时候便直接拿起还热乎的面团，沾着白砂糖一口吞下去了。在老家土胚房住的小狗也围着打转转摇尾巴。婆婆已经忘记忘记怎么做艾米果了，她也已经忘记怎么做饭了。婆婆和大家坐在一起说笑，时间在她身上早已固定在那几分钟以内了。她总是重复地问着几个问题：“涵涵几年级了？”，“涵涵可是初一了？”，“多多（我哥哥）上高中了吗？”。又是蹦出几句格格不入的话语，但我们大家都陪着她，接着她的话，和她笑。那时候，公公已经过世了，婆婆的记忆也变得混乱了。小时候，婆婆也很会做菜，兴国米粉鱼、烧皮肉、兴国鱼丝等等都是她的拿手好菜。最有特色的，便是她的jian蜜（即蘸酱）。如今，我已经五六年没有吃过婆婆的饭了。最近的一次，我们去养老院看婆婆，从靠休息厅的电梯上去，进门便一眼看见了婆婆。“妈！”我妈妈喊她。婆婆坐在椅子上，好一会儿才反应过来，身边的护士提醒她说：“你女儿来看你啦！”婆婆呆呆地看着我，盯了好一会儿。妈妈对她说：“这是涵涵呀！”

Mugwort cake is one of the unique traditional foods of this city. Like its name, mugwort cake is a rice cake made from mugwort. The mugwort must first be finely chopped, mixed with flour, kneaded into a green dough, and then wrapped with the fillings like dumplings. When I was a child, my grandma from my mother’s side would make mugwort cake on Qingming Festival, and we would go to pick mugwort ourselves. At that time, I was still young and couldn’t chop mugwort with a big kitchen knife, so I could only watch my grandma chop up the separated leaves of wormwood rhythmically and turn them into a green paste. After a few years, my grandma stopped making mugwort cakes. My mother’s hometown, which we returned to every year for Qingming festival, gradually grew apart from our lives as we no longer return there. The last time I made mugwort cakes was at my mother’s hometown in the suburbs. Everyone got together. While the adults were carefully kneading the dough and wrapping the mugwort cakes, the other children and I were playing with the dough as if it was clay. When we get too hungry that we couldn’t wait for all the mugwort cakes to be finished, we would directly pull away a piece of dough, put it in the steamer for a few minutes until cooked through, dip it in white sugar, and swallow it in one gulp. The puppies who lived in the adobe house also circled around and wagged their tails as we were busy eating the mugwort cakes. My grandma simply forgot how to make mugwort cakes, and she has also forgotten how to cook. Grandma sat and laughed with everyone. Sometimes I felt like time had already been fixed within a few minutes for her. She always asked the same questions repeatedly: “What grade is Hanhan (my pet name) in?”, “Is Hanhan in the first year of junior high school?”, “Has Duoduo (my brother’s pet name) gone to high school?”. A few sentences that seemed out of place would popped up here and there, but we all stayed with her, following her sentences and laughing with her. At that time, my grandpa had passed away, and my grandma’s memory became mixed up. When I was young, my grandma was also very good at cooking. Xingguo rice noodle fish, roasted pork, Xingguo shredded fish, etc. were all her specialties. The most distinctive dish of her cooking is her dipping sauce. Now, I haven’t eaten my grandma’s meal for five or six years. The most recent time, we went to see my grandma in a nursing home. We went up the elevator next to the lounge and saw grandma as soon as we entered the door. “Mom!” my mother called to her. Grandma sat on the chair, and it took a while for her to react. The nurse next to her reminded her, “Your daughter is coming to see you!” Grandma smiled at my mother and stared at me blankly for a long time.

婆婆坐在她的床上，两只赤裸的脚悬在空中，前后晃动着，像极了一个好奇的小孩。她嘴里说着“去买菜啊”，“去回呀”，仿佛自己仍旧生活在好几年前。我觉得，属于她的时间也许真的停留在了八九年前公公去世的时候。我记得那天上午舅舅打电话给妈妈说公公去世了。他去世得好安详，甚至一点症状都没有，大概是在梦中走的吧！早上婆婆喊公公起来吃早饭，喊了好几声都没应，进公公房间时才发现人已经离开了。在婆婆的房间里，爸爸和哥哥坐在我旁边，他们让我再去看公公最后一眼，但我没有去。这不仅是因为我其实和公公没有过直接的交流，还因为我对死亡和死者的恐惧。公公是一个眼里的人，他和爷爷一样参过军，但我的爷爷是世界上最温柔的人——甚至比奶奶更温柔。小时候每周六中午回公公婆婆家吃饭的时候，公公每次都要准时开饭，在饭桌上他的言语我已经记不清了，但我记得他总是责怪我妈妈吃饭少、只吃菜，总是会询问我哥哥的近况而从来不向我说话，我还记得他有一次为哥哥买了个新的大碗，但我还用着原来的小碗。公公还是个易怒的人，一次从酒席回家，不知为何便在家中开始训斥起来，脚步声踢踢踏踏得响，那时听着只是刺耳。我和哥哥躲在婆婆的房间里，每人手中拿着一本绘本，将一页的图案都记在脑中了却迟迟不敢翻面。公公去世时，我并没有很大的感触。对死亡的恐惧占据了我的心灵和脑海，我只是一味地畏惧死亡而从来没有想过当我真正遇见死亡的时候我该如何做，于是，那时的我选择了逃避。当我的公公就在隔壁房间的时候，我拒绝去看他最后一面。公公走后，妈妈时而会问我：“还记得公公吗？”说实话，随着时间的流逝，外公用过的东西也被收起来了，我对外公的音容笑貌也逐渐模糊，家人也不再谈起外公，许多亲戚过年时也不再来家里拜访了，年夜饭变得凄凉很多。

Grandma was sitting on her bed, with two naked feet hanging in the air, shaking back and forth like a curious child. She said “Go shopping”, “Go back”, as if she was still living in the world several years ago. I think that her time may have stopped when grandpa passed away eight or nine years ago. I remember that my uncle called my mother that morning to say that grandpa had passed away. He passed away so peacefully. Without any symptoms at all. Probably in a dream! In the morning, grandma called grandpa to get up for breakfast, but there was no response after calling several times. Entering grandpa’s room, she found that he had already left. In grandma’s room, my father and my brother sat next to me. They asked me to go to see grandpa one last time, but I didn’t go. This was not only because I actually had no direct communication with my grandpa, but also because of my fear of death and the dead. My grandpa from my mother’s side is a strict person. He served in the army like grandpa from my father’s side, but my grandpa from my father’s side is the most gentle person in the world. When I was young, when I went back to my grandparents’ house for lunch every Saturday at noon, my grandpa would start eating meals on time every time. I can’t remember what he said at the lunch table, but I remember he always blamed my mother for eating too little and not eating any rice. He always asked about my brother’s recent situation and never really spoke to me. Grandpa once bought a new big ceramic bowl for my brother, but I still used the original small stainless steel one. Grandpa was also an irritable person. Once, he came home from a meal with relatives, he began to shout in agitation. The sound of his footsteps was loud and ear-piercing. My brother and I hid in grandma’s room, each of us holding a picture book in our hands, already memorizing all the patterns on one page but daring not to turn it over. When grandpa passed away, I didn’t have much emotion. The fear of death occupied my heart and mind. I was blindly afraid of death and never thought about what I should do when I actually met death, so I chose to escape at that time. I refused to see my grandpa one last time when he was in the next room. After grandpa left, my mother would sometimes ask me, “Do you still remember your grandpa?” To be honest, as time went by, the things that my grandpa used were put away, and his voice and smile gradually became blurred. The weekly lunch meals at home became yearly gatherings in Pizza Hut or other restaurants in the mall. Relatives stopped visiting us during the Lunar New Year, and the New Year’s Eve dinner became cold and lonely.
