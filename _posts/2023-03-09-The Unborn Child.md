**3/9 at physics exam**

Swallowing down two loafs of bread
Or a bottle of left over milk from yesterday night
Wondering
How will life be if my sister were alive
Born in America, raised in Ganzhou
But no one knows I had a sister
It could be a brother
Dead in my mother’s womb
Turned into blood and flowed with the water down the toilet.
My mom called,
“Flowed away in the morning”
“Blood all over.”
In Texas my dad signed
I forget if he told me this
Or I heard it over the phone
No one knows.

(I know it’s crappy. Please don’t judge. I just want to quickly jot down my thoughts. )
